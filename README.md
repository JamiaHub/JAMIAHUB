## JAMIAHUB

JamiaHub is a modern, fast, and developer-friendly platform created by Mahtab Madni, an ECE student at Jamia Millia Islamia and founder of JamiaHub. It’s designed to empower students with a collaborative, resource-driven hub while showcasing cutting-edge web development practices.

👉 This version makes JamiaHub clearly your creation, while also showing off the tech stack you’ve mastered.
Would you like me to also add a “Vision” section that explains JamiaHub’s mission (student collaboration, shared knowledge, community-driven platform)? That would make the README even more personal and inspiring.
